### Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
Udacity Data Analyst Degree - Project II


### Overview
In this project, I will explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Using Python, I will write a code import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing <b>descriptive statistics</b>. I will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.


### Files used
* bikeshare_2.py
* Chicago.csv
* New York City.csv
* Washington.csv


## What Software Do I Need?
To complete this project, i'll require the following softwares:

- Python 
- A text editor, like Sublime or Atom
- A terminal application


### **Statistics Computed:**
The code helps user to tell about bike share use in _Chicago_, _New York City_ and _Washington_ by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, the code output will provide the following information:

* Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time):
  - most common month
  - most common day of week
  - most common hour of day

* Popular stations and trip:
  - most common start station
  - most common end station
  - most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

* Trip duration:
  - total travel time
  - average travel time
  
* User info:
  - counts of each user type
  - counts of each gender (only available for _NYC_ and _Chicago_)
  - earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for _NYC_ and _Chicago_)
